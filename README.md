# GameEngineProject
I have decided to create my own game engine. I have almost no experience in anything like this and it is supposed to take a long time. I will be logging my journey ~~in audio files and~~ in text where necessary along with all the files. My goal is to finish this project in 3 years before my graduation. I will not be using AI if I can help it.
